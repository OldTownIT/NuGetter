NuGetter
========

The NuGet project was designed to provide developers with a standardized mechanism for sharing and installing code, assemblies, etc. The creation of the packages is pretty straightforward to do in a manual way but wouldnâ€™t it be nice if it was all automated? And, not just the packaging, the versioning and deploying should be automated as well. This way, you as the developer can create a library, build it, deploy it and immediately test it.

This is the goal of NuGetter - it is an extension to the Team Foundation Server 2012 build process that will perform all of the necessary versioning, packaging and deployment functions in a customizable and completely repeatable way.

NuGetter does not require but works better and provides more robust build features when used with  TfsVersioning build versioning manager (CodePlex Project)
